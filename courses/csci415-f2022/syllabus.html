      <h1 class="display-4">Course Description</h1>
      <p>
      This course will help you develop a relatively deep knowledge of the
      Linux/Unix userspace programming environment, and how a userspace process
      interacts with the operating system kernel.  Topics covered include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>File I/O and file systems</li>
        <li>Signals</li>
        <li>Process management</li>
        <li>Network programming</li>
        <li>Event-driven I/O</li>
        <li>Multi-threaded programming</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      By the end of this course, you will have a better understanding of how
      various systems and systems-level tools - such as the shell, a cron
      service, a key-value server, and a chat server - are implemented at the
      programmatic level.
      </p>

      <p>
      This course is programming-intensive: you will develop several projects
      that incorporate the above topics.  You will primarily use the C
      programming language to implement these projects.  Time-permitting, the
      course may also cover shell scripting and the Rust programming language.
      </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Prerequisites</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>CSCI 304: Computer Organization</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="display-4">Mechanics</h1>
      <p>
      Generally, we will use 
      <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/416439">gradescope</a>
      for project submissions, and 
      <a href="https://blackboard.wm.edu/ultra/courses/_23716_1/cl/outline">Blackboard</a> 
      for the exam submission.  We will also use Blackboard for any online
      discussions, for posting any lecture recordings, as well as for tracking
      grades.  Otherwise, the course materials will be published via this
      website.
      </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Equipment</h1>
      <p>
      You are free to develop the projects using whatever setup you like.  The
      official setup is of course the gradescope environment, which is a
      standard Ubuntu Linux 22.04 system.  The projects themselves have very few
      dependencies, so any recent Linux distribution will likely suffice.
      <p>

      <p>
      If you wish, you can develop your projects on the CS department's Linux
      <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~tadavis/remoteaccess.html">lab</a>,
      which allows for remote access.  If you do not already have an account,
      please follow the <a href="https://www.cs.wm.edu/~tadavis/remoteaccess.html">instructions</a>
      for requesting access.
      </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Graded Materials and Grading</h1>
      <p>
      The course has seven programming assignments and a final exam.  The
      programming projects account for 70% of your grade, and the final exam
      the remaining 30%.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each programming assignment is scored out of 100 points and carries equal
      weight.  For undergraduates, I will count only your five best
      assignments,  and for masters students, your six best assignments. 
      If a student submits more than this required number, then the student's
      lowest scoring assignment(s) will be counted as extra credit at 50% of
      their value.
      </p>

      <p>
      For instance, if an undergraduate submits six assignments with scores of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>project 0: 90</li>
        <li>project 1: 60</li>
        <li>project 2: 75</li>
        <li>project 3: not submitted</li>
        <li>project 4: 85</li>
        <li>project 5: 100</li>
        <li>project 6: 80</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      and earns an 87 on the final exam, then the student's total final score
      is:
      </p>

      <div class="overflow-scroll">
      \[ \left(\left(\frac{(100 + 90 + 85 + 80 + 75) + (0.5 * 60)}{500} \times 0.7\right) + \left(\frac{87}{100} \times 0.3\right)\right) \times 100\% = 90.5\% \]
      </div>

      <p>
      The final score for a master's student with the same set of scores would be:
      </p>

      <div class="overflow-scroll">
      \[ \left(\left(\frac{(100 + 90 + 85 + 80 + 75 + 60)}{600} \times 0.7\right) + \left(\frac{87}{100} \times 0.3\right)\right) \times 100\% = 83.3\% \]
      </div>

      <p> Your final numeric grade will be mapped into a letter grade "on the
      curve."  Generally, 90 and above is an A; 80 to 89.99 is a B, and so on.
      I will adjust this scale downward as necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are no project extensions: every project is due on its due date.
      </p>

      <p>
      Nearly every project will have extra credit points.  I also plan to post
      one or two smaller assignments which are purely for extra credit toward
      projects.
      </p>

      <p>
      While this is the initial grading plan, I reserve the right to adapt this
      plan throughout the semester to best meet the needs of the class.
      </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Honor Code</h1>
      <p>
      William &amp; Mary has a significant tradition in its
      <a
        href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/honorcodeandcouncils/index.php">honor
      code</a>, stated below:
      </p>

      <div class="m-3">
        <blockquote class="p-3 bg-secondary text-white rounded">As a member of the William &amp; Mary
        community, I pledge on my honor not to lie, cheat, or steal, either in
        my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the
        Honor Code and undermine the community of trust, of which we are all
        stewards.
        </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>
      For this course, programming assignments must be completed on your own.
      The operative rule is that you may consult with your classmates
      on general issues about an assignment, but code remains private.  You
      should neither show another your program source code, nor look at
      another's source code.  Beyond that, you should adopt an "empty hands"
      attitude toward collaboration: talk about the project as you wish, but
      leave the conversation with nothing written.
      </p>

      <p>There are three corollaries to this rule:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not post your code on a public repository.</li>
        <li>If you copy or lightly adapt source from any site on the Internet,
          you must cite the URL in a comment.</li>
        <li>If you come to me or the TA for help, we will not "eyeball debug"
          your code; that is, for all but the most trivial problems for which
          you ask for help, we won't look at your source code.  Short of
          looking at your source code, I'm more than willing to help you design
          and debug your program.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      I reserve the right to use an automated service to screen project
      submissions for cases of code sharing.
      </p>


      <h1 class="display-4">Attendance</h1>
      <p>
      I do not take attendance: attendance and classroom participation are not a
      component of your final grade.  
      </p>

      <!--
      <p>
      To account for common situations that might interfere with a student
      completing an assignment (such as a cold, job interview, or a conflicting
      due date with another course), I allow undergraduates to skip two
      assignments, and masters students one assignment.  If you have an
      exceptional case where you will be out for an extended period of time,
      please discuss the matter with me, and I will attempt to adapt the
      coursework appropriately.
      </p>
      -->

      <h1 class="display-4">Accommodations</h1>

      <p>
      William &amp; Mary accommodates students with disabilities in accordance with
      federal laws and university policy. Any student who feels they may need
      an accommodation based on the impact of a learning, psychiatric,
      physical, or chronic health diagnosis should contact Student
      Accessibility Services staff at 757-221-2512 or at
      <a href="mailto:sas@wm.edu">sas@wm.edu</a> to
      determine if accommodations are warranted and to obtain an official
      letter of accommodation. For more information, please see
      <a href="www.wm.edu/sas"> www.wm.edu/sas.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      As per the university's <a
         href="https://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/resources/holidays/religiousguidelines/index.php">guidance</a>,
      if you have a religious observance that conflicts with a deadline,
      please notify me as soon as possible so that I can attempt to make an
      appropriate adjustment.
      </p>
